I am a 3rd year Ph.D student at IIT Guwahati, India.

My research interests are in Deep Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Federated Learning, Neural Networks, and basically anything and everything about AI!

I'm currently working towards my Ph.D. thesis titled: Immuno-inspired Federated Reinforcement Learning in a Network of Robots. This basically means making a robotic network learn to perform tasks together using Federated Reinforcement Learning.

I aspire to become an AI scientist, solving problems that truly matter and have the potential to be converted into business! 

A huge believer in collaborative research work. Do contact me at gayathri.rangu@iitg.ac.in for any collaborations.
