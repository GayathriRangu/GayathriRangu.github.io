👩‍🎓I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at IIT Guwahati, India 🇮🇳:.

🤖My research interests are in Deep Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Federated Learning, Neural Networks, and basically anything and everything about AI!

📑I'm currently working towards my Ph.D. thesis titled: 👉Immuno-inspired Federated Reinforcement Learning in a Network of Robots👈. This basically means making a robotic network learn to perform tasks together using Federated Reinforcement Learning.

👩‍💻I aspire to become an AI scientist, solving problems that truly matter and have the potential to be converted into business! 

🤝A huge believer in collaborative research work. Do contact me at 📧gayathri.rangu@iitg.ac.in for any collaborative work.
